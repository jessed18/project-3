# Doable - Task Management Web App

## Overview / Description
Doable is a simple and practical web app I built to help keep track of tasks and stay organized. The idea was to create a lightweight task manager where you can add, complete, delete, and filter tasks—all in one clean interface.  

It also includes a contact form so users can send messages directly through the app. The goal was to make task management as straightforward and visual as possible, without overcomplicating things.  


## How to Use
1. **Open the App:** Start the app with `npm start` and open it in your browser.  
2. **Add a Task:** Type in a task in the input field and click "Add."  
3. **Manage Tasks:**  
   - Check the box to mark a task as done.  
   - Click the ✕ to delete a task you no longer need.  
4. **Filter Tasks:** Use the "All," "Active," and "Done" buttons to focus on what matters.  
5. **Contact Form:** Navigate to the Contact page to send a quick message with your name, email, and comments.  



## Functionality Offered
- **Add and Track Tasks:** Quickly jot down what you need to get done.  
- **Complete or Delete Tasks:** Keep your list relevant and up-to-date.  
- **Filter by Status:** Easily focus on tasks you haven’t finished yet.  
- **Responsive Layout:** Looks good on desktop and mobile screens.  
- **Contact Form:** A simple way for users to reach out.  
- **No Backend Required:** Fully client-side, so you can use it without extra setup.  



## Technologies Used
- **React (JSX/TSX):** Component-based structure and dynamic updates.  
- **React Router:** Smooth navigation between pages.  
- **CSS:** Styling, layout, and responsive design.  
- **JavaScript:** Handling state, adding/removing tasks, and form interactions.  



## Ideas for Future Improvement
1. **Add Due Dates & Priorities:** Let users assign deadlines and importance to tasks.  
2. **Persistent Storage:** Save tasks to localStorage or a backend so nothing is lost on refresh.  
3. **Notifications or Reminders:** Alert users about upcoming tasks.  
4. **Edit Existing Tasks:** Make it possible to update task titles or details.  
5. **Dark Mode:** Give users the option to switch between light and dark themes.  



## About
I built this project as part of a React-focused assignment to practice component-based design, state management, and creating an interactive interface. It was a fun challenge to make a clean, usable task manager without adding unnecessary complexity.
